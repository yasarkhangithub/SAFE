Requirements for queries:

We denote the minimal set of data sources for each query in the following:

 q_simple: DBpedia

 q1: DBpedia, Semantic Web Dog Food
 q2: DBPedia, Drugbank
 q3: Drugbank, KEGG
 q4: DBPedia, LinkedMDB, NYTimes
 q5: DBpedia, NYTimes
 queries: DBPedia, Semantic Web Dog Food
   
Known Issues: 

* The drugbank SPARQL endpoint at high load times has very poor response times,
   all queries to be evaluated there do not work properly in such case.
* The NYTimes SPARQL endpoint is currently out of service, queries mus be run
   against a local copy 
* The total evaluation time depends on the load of the server => Sometimes query
   response time is quite slow. If this is the case, try again later
